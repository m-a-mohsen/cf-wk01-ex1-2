### Intro to Frontend Development
# 1.2: HTML and the Web

## Directions
### Part 1

Open a new file in your text editor and set up your HTML document. Remember, you first need a declaration to tell the browser that this is an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html>.
Next, add the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. Don’t forget to close the tags! Your <head> and <body> elements should be nested inside of your <html> element.
Inside the <head> element, you only need to add the <title> element for now, so pick a title you like and add it to the code.
Within the body tag, just write “Hello World” for now.
Save your file as “home.html”.
Once you’ve saved your file, open it in your web browser:
To do so, double-click on the file in your file explorer, and it should open in your default web browser.
If Chrome isn’t your default web browser, change it to Chrome or right-click on the file and select “Open with” → “Chrome.”
Add a favicon to your HTML file inside of the <head> element using the code from the Exercise. (Hint: look for the <link> tag. This can be the same favicon Wikipedia uses for now.)
After adding your favicon, make sure you save your file. Then, go back to your browser and refresh the site to see your changes. You should now see the favicon on top. Congratulations—you’ve created your first simple HTML site!
The image below shows you how to add your own favicon to your HTML file:

The next image shows how to store the favicon in the img folder. Have you noticed the updated relative path of the favicon?

### Part 2

Take the image of the portfolio site design from above and annotate as many of the HTML tags as you can to create the basic HTML structure. (Tip: To annotate screens, you can use any program you like. We recommend Skitch for Mac, Jing, or the built-in snipping tool for Windows.)
Once you’re happy with your code and annotations, save both files and compress them into a single zip file. (If you’re not sure how to compress multiple files into a single zip file, check out these instructions on zipping files on Mac or Windows.) Then, upload the file here. Feel free to share additional thoughts or ask questions on your submission page.

### Bonus Tasks:

1. Want to use your own favicon instead of the Wikipedia one? Go ahead and make your own! Once your image is ready, use Favic-o-matic to ensure it’s “favicon-ready.”
2. Feel like you’re already ready to move beyond annotating and want to write the HTML structure itself? Go ahead and give it a try by creating the HTML structure from the annotated image we have provided in the Exercise! Add the HTML structure to your new “home.html” file and submit it along with the rest of your work. You’ll review it at the start of the next Exercise.
